# Revealing_Fraudlent_Transaction_using_Machine-Learning
 The purpose of this project is to detect the fraudulent transactions made by credit cards
using machine learning techniques, to stop fraudsters from the unauthorized usage of customersâ€™ 
accounts. The increase of credit card fraud is growing rapidly worldwide, which is the reason 
actions should be taken to stop fraudsters. Putting a limitfor those actions would have a positive
impact on the customers as their money would berecovered and retrieved back into their accounts 
and they will not be charged for items or services that were not purchased by them which isthe main
goal of the project.
Detection of the fraudulent transactions will be made by using four machine learning 
techniques KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, those models will be used on a credit card
transaction dataset.
